# Task_2-EDA
Before jumping into any machine learning or data modeling, it's super important to get to know your data. This guide walks you through exactly how to do that — using Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
What You'll Be Doing:
Load and explore your dataset (CSV or any tabular data)
quick overview: What columns are there? Any missing values?
Visualize distributions of numbers and categories
Spot patterns and relationships between features
Catch any weird stuff — like outliers, skewed data, or strong correlations
Start thinking about how you might clean or transform the data later
Tools You'll Use:
Pandas – for wrangling and summarizing the data
Matplotlib & Seaborn – for clean, insightful visuals
Plotly – for interactive charts if you want to explore deeper
Why This Matters:
Doing EDA is like scouting the map before a road trip. It gives you direction, helps you avoid trouble spots (like bad data), and can even reveal cool shortcuts (strong features or trends you didn’t expect).
Whether you’re building models, preparing a report, or just exploring — this is where the magic starts.
